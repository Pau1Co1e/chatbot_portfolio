# Paul Coleman - AI/ML Engineer and Full-Stack Developer

Welcome to my portfolio repository! I am Paul Coleman, an AI and Machine Learning Engineer with a professional background in full-stack development. My passion lies in leveraging technology to solve complex problems, particularly in the realms of finance, healthcare, and robotics.

## About Me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Utah Valley University and am currently pursuing my Master's degree. My professional journey includes experience as a full-stack developer at ResNexus, where I developed APIs, enhanced data integrity, and contributed to both backend and frontend systems. At Utah Valley University, I led a team in developing AI-driven robotics systems for object recognition and natural language processing, while also implementing network security measures.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've built from the ground up:

1. **CodeBloodedBot - The Q&A AI Model:**
   A custom-trained Q&A transformer model designed to answer questions about my portfolio and expertise. Built on ALBERT and fine-tuned with personal and external datasets, it provides accurate and dynamic responses to user queries. The bot is deployed via Flask and FastAPI and integrated into my website.

2. **Fractal Dimension Calculator:**
   An innovative tool to compute the fractal dimension of images or datasets, offering insights into patterns and structures. This project leverages mathematical concepts and image processing techniques, showcasing my interest in combining theoretical math with practical AI solutions.

3. **Financial Prediction Model:**
   Developed a predictive model to forecast stock prices using machine learning techniques, including time-series analysis and neural networks.

4. **Anti-Spam System:**
   Developed an AI-driven system leveraging LSTM-based RNNs to detect and filter out spam messages in real-time. The model processed sequential text data to identify patterns indicative of spam, achieving high accuracy in classification. Preprocessing steps included tokenization, word embeddings, and padding for compatibility with the LSTM layers. This system significantly enhanced communication reliability by adapting to evolving spam trends.

5. **Deepfake Detection Tool:**
   Engineered a tool to identify deepfake videos using advanced computer vision algorithms.
